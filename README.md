- 👋 Hi, I’m @eyezyer
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to run newer OSes on older Apple hardware. I have a cMP 5,1, a 3,1 and a 2,1. Running Monterey via OpenCore and BigMac2 on the 5,1 and 3,1 and running ElCap on the 2,1 via a modified EFI. All have boot camp running Windows 11.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Xcode to compile apps for tvOS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. I'm not skilled enough just yet.
- 📫 How to reach me eyezyer@gmail.com
